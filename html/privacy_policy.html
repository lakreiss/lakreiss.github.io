            I wanted to test out giving people the option to sign in with their gmail if they want to send an email to me. The only info I need to collect for that is the user's email after they log in, and access to sending emails (which they would compose). No data would be stored by me; everything is done client-side in javascript.
            <br><br>I'm not sure what else I need to say here; I'm not trying to do anything malicious. If there's some vulnerability with what I'm doing, please tell me and I'll take this down immediately. Thanks!
