            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>I recently graduated from UC Berkeley with a major in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and a minor in Education.</p>
            <p>While I was at Cal, I played frisbee for the <a href="http://www.ugmo.org" target="_blank">Cal Ultimate team.</a></p>
            <p>Now I work at Google, and in my free time, I've been collaborating with <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/friends-of-all-ages/home" target="_blank">Friends of All Ages</a>, a Bay Area non-profit aiming to build intergenerational community - one book at a time.</p>
            <p>Some of my various interests include reading, cryptography, sports analytics, critical education theory, and balanced ternary.</p>
            <p>I'm building web apps right now, so if you have a fun idea, let me know!</p>
