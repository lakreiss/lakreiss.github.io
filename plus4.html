          <h1>Plus4</h1>
          <p>Plus4 is written in Java with the JavaFX library.</p>
          <p>The game is similar to connect four, in which the goal is to place four of your pieces in a line. However, in Plus4, pieces are always placed into the
            top of the board, and only fall down if they are pushed from above. Once a piece has been pushed four times, it falls out from the bottom of the board and disappears.</p>
          <p>The more you play against the "Intelligent" computer, the better it will get at beating you, so good luck!</p>
          <p>Code for Plus4 is available <a href="https://github.com/lakreiss/Plus4" target="blank">here</a>.</p>
